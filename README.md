# recurse-core-2015

Recurse Center data science project for the Clojure Cup of 2015

## Overview

Recursers collaborated on a project where we created a food map of
NYC, showing the different types of restaurants that a neighborhood
contained, and then allowed a user to pick their neighborhood and
have their neighborhood audited for food types.

[DOHNMH New York City Restaurant Results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j)
[Legally Operating Businesses](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Legally-Operating-Businesses/w7w3-xahh)

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
